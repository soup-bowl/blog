## :wave: Hello! I’m Casey…
…and I love technology. I have been working with various different technologies since I was young and so far the only answer tech hasn’t given me is how to stop!

## :computer: Speciality
### Web Development
My language of choice is **PHP** for the past **4 years**. I have learned the art through an apprenticeship with the *Building Research Establishment* since I was 19. The team was a mixed bag of different development styles, so I know how to code by the book, quickly in an emergency, how to test and debug other peoples’ work, and how to quickly grasp and maintain legacy code.

**WordPress** is my speciality CMS. The sheer flexibility of WordPress is my favourite aspect, and always leaves me [trying to push it to the extremes](https://www.soupbowl.io/kebabble/). I am experienced at hook/filter development and minor theme-related developments, and regularly attend WordPress Meetups to share knowledge with the wider community.

The tools of my PHP trade are:
* Composer.
* Phpunit.
* Codesniffer (WordPress Coding Standards).
* WP-CLI (also built CLI extensions).

I am also currently teaching myself **Java** and **Python**, having learned **C#** during my apprenticeship. I am fond of cross-platform interoperability which put me off continuing with C#. It’s no longer the case with .NET Core, but Java has won me over.

### Databases
Due to my work with WordPress my database experience is both **MySQL** and **MariaDB**, however I am also experienced with **Microsoft SQL** due to a large portion of systems I have dealt with being Windows-based.

### Operations (DevOps)
I love configuring servers. I have been assisting operations teams with configuring code-purposed servers for the past 4 years, to help ensure they are built not only for their intended purposes but as future-proofed as they can be. What good is a brand-new web server if it will be unsupported in a year?

My newest experiment is with **Docker**. After spending long hours staring at the documentation and not understanding the point it serves, after a eureka moment I now can’t stop using Docker! My primary passion is compiling development-related compose files and image setups, with the goal of forever killing the age-old ‘it works on my machine’ phenomena for good.

## :desktop_computer: Other Technology
I absolutely love hardware tinkering. My home desk is a vision of phone parts and random screws, and I love fixing up old phones to try old technology and alpha software on. A broken screen is a challenge, not a moment to dispair! I strongly support **Right to Repair**, and advocate for sustainable, self-fixable technology.

In fact, **vintage technology** is my passion! I am an avid collector of the old technology, and always try to find modern-day uses for them without resorting to salvaging. **Retro consoles** are my specialty, in particular the **PlayStation 2**.

My devcave is filled with **Raspberry Pis** and **Arduinos**. There is not a challenge that can’t be solved with a handy Pi! I currently have a **Pi Zero cluster** (named **Anton Jr** in reference to *Silicon Valley*) running **Docker Swarm**… Why? Why not!
