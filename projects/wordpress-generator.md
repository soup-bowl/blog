**Quickly create WordPress setups for development and testing. [5 minute install be damned](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/), how’s 0?**

Sometimes you want to make a quick change to your WordPress site, but then the dread sets in… **WIll it break it?**

Rather than hoping for the best, how about quickly testing it elsewhere? And how about **collaborating** with others on it?

Let me introduce to you, VVV– \*ahem\* **WordPress Generator**!

## :question: What does it do?

Simple! WordPress Generator is a simple application installed like WordPress itself. However, the Generator will **create temporary sites** within itself, like a small factory.

This is very similar in approach to what [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) does. However, the Generator is not dependent on anything outside of a simple webhost. You can run it locally, or run it on a development server – choice is yours!

## :floppy_disk: Where can I get it?

Head on over to the **BRE Digital GitHub** to grab the latest and greatest release. The instructions on the GitHub page will guide you on setting it up.

It can also be run via :whale: **Docker**! Take a gander at the Dockerhub page to see how you could whack this mighty beast into your container network.

Grab WordPress Generator from:
