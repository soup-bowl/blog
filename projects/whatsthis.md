**Quickly check what technology a website is using.**

My ReactJS experiments with front-end JavaScript developments have been poured into this project. Resulting in a web application that will identify common functionalities of a website and make a reasonably good attempt at identifying the website technology.

<div class="aligncentre">
	<p class="button"><a href="https://whatsth.is">What's This? Tool</a></p>
</div>

This project consists of two parts:
- **[Frontend][frontend-gh]** - A React JavaScript application built using TypeScript and Axios.
- **[Backend][backend-gh]** - Python-based simple HTTP API with XPath detection technology.
