**Did you ever want to link your WordPress account to your standalone OpenSimulator account? No? Oh… Well, you can now.**

Using the [Remote Administration](http://opensimulator.org/wiki/RemoteAdmin) interface provided by OpenSimulator, and my dashingly handsome plugin, you can now control your OpenSimulator account via WordPress!

What this plugin-

## :heavy_check_mark: Can do

*   Create OpenSimulator users.
*   Update own passwords.
*   Specify a limited surname constraint.

## :x: Can’t do

*   Control elevated privileges.
*   Control aspects of the grid.
*   Make coffee in the morning.

Give it a shot now!
