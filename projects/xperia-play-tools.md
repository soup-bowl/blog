title: Xperia Play Tools
---

**Flash, root and setup the Xperia Play in just a few clicks. Getting this emulation beast setup has never been easier.**

**Xperia Play Tools (XPT)** is a **Python, cross-platform command line** tool for re-purposing the **Xperia Play** as the perfect emulation device. This small, simple tool will let you:

*   **Reflash** your Play with **Sony firmware files (ftf)**.
*   **Root** compatible firmwares with **zergRush**, and setup **Superuser**.
*   Remove bloatware/redundant apps to free up space and memory.
*   Automatically install a chosen subset of apps.

Future additions will include:

*   Automatic custom bootloader.
*   Manage (or synchronise) content from PC to Play.
