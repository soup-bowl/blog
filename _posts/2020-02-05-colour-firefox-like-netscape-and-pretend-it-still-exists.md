**I love Netscape. I still haven’t forgiven AOL [for the event that occurred February 2008](https://www.engadget.com/2014/05/10/history-of-netscape/).**

Firefox has decided that the colouring of your browser should be left to you. While it may not be the elaborate and fancy themes of old, at least you can still have a level of customisation to your boring browser window.

Here are some colour themes I have created to re-live the glory days of Netscape Navigator.

**Edit from 2021:** If you’re happy to go through some effort to apply a Firefox theme, I ported **Modern Modoki** a popular Netscape port theme from Firefox 3 to userChrome CSS. [**Go to the GitHub page**](https://github.com/soup-bowl/Modoki-FirefoxCSS) to find out more.

## Netscape Fusion

## And the Final Touch…
You can add the throbber into your header!
