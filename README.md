The main **[soupbowl.io](https://www.soupbowl.io)** website, but in automatic build-and-deploy [Jekyll][j] flavour.

## Compiling with Jekyll
Installation of Jekyll is **not necessary**, as the **Docker Compose** script included with the repository will run the process for you. Upon running `docker-compose up`, the `_site` directory will be created and re-populated upon each edit.
